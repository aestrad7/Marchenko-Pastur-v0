# Marchenko-Pastur Theorem

This repository explores the Marchenko-Pastur theorem and its applications in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

## Overview

The Marchenko-Pastur theorem is a mathematical result that characterizes the eigenvalue distribution of a random matrix with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries. It provides insights into the behavior of eigenvalues in high-dimensional datasets, making it a valuable tool in PCA.
